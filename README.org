#+title: MPC Wrapper

* What it Does
MPC wrapper is an emacs lisp wrapper for several mpc commands. It does not provide a complete interface, just the materials to create one for yourself.
Here's the function I use.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun music-menu ()
    "Play music from a menu."
    (interactive)
    (mpc-clear)
    (mpc-add (completing-read "Choose a song: " (mpc-ls)))
    (mpc-play))
#+end_src

It does not currently wrap every command, but it does cover the major ones.

* Requirements
Have mpc & mpd installed & set up.

* Why another MPD Package?
Every MPD package that I've seen interface directly with MPD, which, in my opinion, makes them very difficult to set up, & causes Emacs to stop loading if it encounters a problem with MPD.
On top of this, I have found that most of these packages are either bloated or very difficult to use.

* Credits
Docstrings taken from mpc's manpage.
